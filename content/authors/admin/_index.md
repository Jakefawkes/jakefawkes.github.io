## About Me

I am a final year PhD student in statistical machine learning at the University of Oxford. My research focuses on the use of causality within machine learning focusing on:

- Using ML techniques to improve estimation of high dimensional treatment effects.
- The application of causal inference in fair machine learning.
- The mathmatical structure of causality. Specifically on understanding what algebraic properties causal systems should satisfy. 

Outside of my PhD I have a strong interest in the following areas:

- Safe and Ethical AI
- Mechanistic Interpretability and Causal Abstraction
- Experimental Design
- Causal Representation Learning
